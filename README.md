# MyLibraryLib

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.17.

 This project is an example to learn to make a Library of components in Angular.

This example is very simple, is only a component with a service. The service can change a label o the component.

In the App Angular Application, I put a button to call the method of the service to send a string to the component to show this string in the component.
